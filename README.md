- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert in my page
- Drag and files from another folders into the MainFolder
- Let you know how to create quickly but in right sense a page on Go



## Installation

You need to get gopath and goroot like a global enviroment [Go Download](https://go.dev/dl/) v1.19.3 to run.

Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/JohanSabino/golangPage
```

Maybe you need to create go.mod and go.sum files, in this case, run on gitbash terminal

```sh
go mod init example.com/
```

## Result

Now, if you wanna just to see the page, go to:
